# Arduino Song Project README

## Project Overview

This Arduino project is a simple example of how to play a song using a passive buzzer and an Arduino board. The project demonstrates how to use an Arduino sketch to generate musical notes and produce sound through the buzzer.

## Components Used

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Passive buzzer
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Setup Instructions

1. Connect the passive buzzer to the Arduino board. You may need to refer to your specific buzzer's datasheet for the pin configuration.

2. Upload the Arduino sketch (`song.ino`) to your Arduino board.

3. Power the Arduino using a USB cable or an external power source.

## Playing the Song

The Arduino sketch provided (`song.ino`) includes the musical notes and timing for the song. Once the sketch is uploaded and the Arduino is powered on, it will play the song.

## Configuration

You can modify the song by editing the `song.ino` sketch. You can change the notes, duration, and the melody to play different songs.

## Troubleshooting

If the song is not playing or you encounter issues, check the following:

- Ensure the passive buzzer is correctly connected to the Arduino pins.
- Verify that the buzzer connections match the pin configurations in the Arduino sketch.
- Check for any syntax errors in the Arduino sketch.
